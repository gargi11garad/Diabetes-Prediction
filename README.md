# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is an **end-to-end ML pipeline** for predicting diabetes based on health indicators.  
It uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset** and demonstrates all the basic steps of a machine learning project — from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
